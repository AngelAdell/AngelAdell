<h1>README: My Journey as a Product Manager</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Angel Adell, and this space is dedicated to sharing my journey as a product manager, with a special focus on my current project, Ephe Collective. In this README, you'll find an overview of my experiences, the projects I've worked on, and the key lessons I've learned along the way. I hope my journey inspires and provides insights to fellow product managers, developers, and anyone interested in product development.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I started my career in the Navy, which laid the foundation for my disciplined and structured approach to problem-solving. After my service, I pursued an MBA and became PMP certified in 2024. My entrepreneurial spirit led me to launch multiple ventures, including a beauty business and now, Ephe Collective.</p>

<h2>My Journey as a Product Manager and Full Stack Developer</h2>

<h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
<p>My journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to help professional women simplify their wardrobe choices for business trips and events. I identified a common pain point—many women, including myself, often struggle with what to wear, especially when traveling for work. This realization led me to explore how technology could solve this problem.</p>

<h3>Transition to Tech</h3>
<p>Determined to bring my idea to life, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and immersed myself in learning software development. This period was challenging but incredibly rewarding, as it allowed me to bridge the gap between my vision and the technical skills needed to execute it.</p>

<h3>Launching Ephe Collective</h3>
<p>Ephe Collective is my current venture, aimed at revolutionizing how professional women approach their wardrobes. Our flagship product, "Traveling Pants," is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that leverages AI to provide personalized wardrobe recommendations. We focus on understanding our users' needs and designing with empathy, ensuring our solutions are both practical and empowering.</p>

<h3>Key Projects</h3>
<p>Traveling Pants Prototype: Developed a prototype that integrates AI to suggest outfits based on user preferences, weather, and event requirements. Prototype Link
Customer Discovery and Validation: Conducted extensive user interviews and testing to refine our product based on real-world feedback.
Hackathon Success: Secured third place in a hackathon, validating our concept and approach.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Empathy in Design: Always start with the user in mind. Understanding their pain points and needs is crucial for developing meaningful solutions.
Iterative Development: Embrace the iterative process. Testing and feedback are invaluable for continuous improvement.
Team Collaboration: Building a strong team with complementary skills is essential. I’m grateful for the support and expertise of my team members, like Olena Lukas, our Chief Design Officer, and Michael Agee, our Software Engineer.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>We are currently preparing for our beta launch in June and are excited about the potential partnerships with boutiques to enhance our product offerings. Our goal is to create a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for our users, ultimately answering the question, "What am I wearing today?"</p>

<h3>Connect with Me</h3>
<p>I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, and new opportunities. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or follow our journey on Instagram and YouTube.</p>
